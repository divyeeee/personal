FFull Bot assembly + Bot fully working :

â€“General pointers
Step 1: 
-	Since the hardware has already been discussed, ask few questions,and handout prizes, if there are.
Step 2: 
-	Can also ask about questions the code.
Step 3: 
-	Chassis setup, talk ,screw motors in, tell few fact about the motor,(12V,brushed motor).
Step 4: 
-	Connecting the the wheels to the motor axle
-	Screw in the caster wheel, first ask if anyone knows about this.
Step 5: 
-Connect in the jumper wires and also tell about different jumper wires, maybe joke about lgbt, double meaning.
Step 6: 
-	First make the connection from esp to the motor driver--input pins 1,2,3,4 to PWM pins 12,13,14,27 or as specified in the ppt--ask questions about the motor driver.
Step 7: 
-	Connect enable pins to GPIO 25,26 pins.
Step 8: 
-	Provide 12v from battery(red)-maybe ask about the color coding, connect ground to motor driver.
-	Provide 5v from motor driver to esp and make ground common- maybe ask some question related to potential difference.

The hardware is done!
Final Step : 
-	Check the ip of the esp.
-	Now configure the ip and password in the code-ask  questions.
-	Full setup is done, troubleshoot problems.
-	Move the bot.
-	Ask about the easter egg.
-	Explain the code to those who ask about the easter egg,
explain utf-8 encoding.
-	Send for obstacle course.
-	Maybe conduct a row wise quiz and distribute prize.
